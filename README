This is an implementation of the SEDAWG-scheme, presented at SECRYPT 2013. The code is fully functional when using the File-system or Amazon-backend.
However, due to the rough and unoptimized design, it is only suited for relatively small text sizes (i.e. a few MB).
This is a limitation which must be improved upon, but remember that 1 MB of ASCII consists of 1 million characters!
Because the input is assumed to be ASCII, please make sure it really is.

The config file "sse.config" allows for easy modification of different parameters.

Usage:

./prepare text : Will prepare a given text for usage with the program. During preparation all occurences of "$" and "#" will be removed and the text will be concluded with a "$"
./create text : Will encrypt a given text according to the SSE protocol. Default blocksize multiplier is 5, ind-cpa security is on. Edit "create" to change the values.
./search word: Searches files created with "create" for a given word and prints out the number of times it is found.

Decryption is not supported at the moment.
