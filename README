This is an implementation of the SEDAWG-scheme, presented at SECRYPT 2013. The code is fully functional when using the File-System-Backend. The Amazon-Backend is broken at the moment and will be fixed later.

This is a new implementation using a more optimized algorithm for graph creation resulting in less memory usage.
Encrypted files generated with the old version can not be used with the new version any longer.

Per MB of input text roughly 300MB of RAM will be needed. The encryption size is roughly 15 MB per MB of input.

Usage:

./prepare text : Will prepare a given text for usage with the program. During preparation all occurences of "$" will be removed and the text will be concluded with a "$".
./create text : Will encrypt a given text according to the SSE protocol. Default blocksize multiplier is 5, ind-cpa security is on. Edit "create" to change the values.
./search word: Searches files created with "create" for a given word and prints out the number of times it is found.

Decryption is not supported at the moment.
